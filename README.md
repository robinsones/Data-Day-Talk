# Data-Day-Talk

Here are my materials for my talk at Data Day Texas, 2018. I will update this when the video of my talk is available in early February. In the meantime, you can view my slides (the pdf), the script I ran through (`data_day_talk_code.Rmd`), or a version of the script with much more explanation (`data_day_script_accompanying.Rmd`).
